                        <p>Collagen: Collagen is the primary protein in the connective tissue of all mammals. Together with Keratin is the foundation for strength and elasticity of human skin. With the release of their composition in the body, it results in lack of water and oxygen begins to create folds that everyone knows as wrinkles.</p>

                        <p>The complex of Amino Acids: Just as collagen produces protein. Unlike plants that can synthesize amino acids through their lives, people do not have this ability. The only way to get them is to consume certain foods and drinks, possibly in consultation with a nutritionist. </p>

                        <p>Blue clay: It is commonly found in Bulgaria, which is one of the most effective natural anti-wrinkle remedies.

Roux female representatives can even wipe their spit and pigmentation. Blue clay consists of other natural minerals which include nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, radium, and phosphate. Since the Middle Ages, women have used it to preserve their youth.</p>

                        <p>Sodium alginate: Everyone loves to go to sea as salt water drains the skin and removes undesirable buds and the sodium alginate contained in algae in the Black Sea revives and moisturizes the skin and completely eliminates toxins.</p>

                        <p>Betaine and Vegetable Oil: Everyone has heard about the marvelous power of plant oils. Therefore, a unique facial mask includes betaine and selected types of oils. They help in smoothing wrinkles, give the general freshness of the face, but also perform some nourishing and moisturizing functions.</p>

                        <p>Palmarosa Essential Oil: Apart from the amazing palmarosa scent is mainly used in aromatherapy, eliminating the negative impact of stress on the skin. It is, therefore, one of the main ingredients of Simple young.</p>
