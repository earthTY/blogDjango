                        <p><strong class="blue">Olive fruit oil</strong> has a rich vitamin composition, which includes vitamins A, E, B, C - vital elements for the growth and health of strands. In addition, the vegetable component includes oleic, linoleic acids, as well as manganese, magnesium, boron, iron, and silicon. All these elements improve the structure of hair, nourishing, strengthening and preventing hair loss. Olive oil also has a beneficial effect on the health of the scalp, prevents the appearance of dandruff and has regenerative effects.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">The complex of proteins</strong> provides full nutrition to strands and is a building material for them. Proteins restore the structure, reduce brittleness, restore healthy shine, make hair the most obedient and visually lush, accelerate hair growth. Deficiency of these important substances inevitably leads to brittleness, weakening, and loss of strands. Also, proteins are able to normalize the work of the sebaceous glands.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">The extract of the Asian</strong> centella contains flavonoids, essential oils, alkaloids, saponins, vitamins and minerals. Active plant extracts improve local microcirculation, enriching the roots of locks with oxygen and nutrients. As a result, the strands become stronger and begin to grow intensively.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">Retinol and tocopherol</strong>, also known as vitamin A and E, are one of the most important nutrients for the hair. Retinol helps to strengthen the hair follicle, eliminates fragility, dryness and lifelessness of the strands, contributing to intensive hair growth. Tocopherol stops the process of hair loss and improves the structure of the hair shaft.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">Vitamin F</strong> contains a complex of unsaturated fatty acids that help digest other vitamins, fight with split ends and eliminate dandruff. Also, vitamin F has a beneficial effect on the vessels and capillaries of the scalp and strengthens them, which in turn has a good effect on the health of the follicle.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">Vitamin D</strong> is useful for curls and scalp. It acts as an important nutrient that increases elasticity and gives natural shine, as well as silkiness to strands. Vitamin strengthens the hair bulb and prevents its loss.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">Shea butter</strong> includes triglycerides, myristic, linoleic acids, proteins, vitamins, which fill curls not only with nutrients but also with natural moisture, eliminating brittleness, dryness and cross-section of tips.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">Avocado oil</strong> contains a large number of amino acids, vitamins B, D, phytosteroids, phosphorus and other useful substances. Active elements of the plant-derived agent contribute to the production of collagen, which is a building material for the hair. Also, the component contributes to the improvement of local circulation and the acceleration of tissue regeneration.</p>
                        <p><strong class="blue">The extract from the root of the highlander</strong> multicolor contains natural antioxidants and substances that improve local blood circulation and slow down the process of graying hair.</p>

                        <div class="list_example">
                            <p>The most common provoking factors that lead to loss and lifelessness of hair include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>hormonal changes in the body;</li>
                                <li>deficiency of vitamins and microelements;</li>
                                <li>frequent staining of hair;</li>
                                <li>external adverse factors;</li>
                                <li>thermal impact;</li>
                                <li>frequent stress.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Hormonal changes are characteristic during the period of childbirth, menopause, and also in the presence of internal pathologies. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in the protective functions of the body and the weakening of all vital internal systems. The person is disturbed by blood circulation, in connection with which the hair begins to not receive nutrients.</p>
                        <p>The lack of vitamins can be caused by improper and unbalanced nutrition, which instantly affects the health of hair.</p>
                        <p>Staining, chemical perm and frequent use of a hair dryer lead to thinning of the hair shaft, weakening of the hair bulb and, as a consequence, to hair loss.</p>
                        <p>Negative impact on the appearance of strands can also external factors such as ultraviolet. Sunlight deprives hair's natural moisture, as a result, the hair will become dull and brittle.</p>
                        <p>Frequent stresses lead to the release of the hormone cortisol, which adversely affects the entire body, including the health of the hair.</p>

                        <p>In the market, there is a large number of hair growth masks, which are positioned as an effective means for restoring growth and strengthening strands. Among the most popular can be identified Derkos, Natura Siberica, Aleran, etc. Producers of these products promise to receive a lush and silky hair. However, numerous negative consumer reviews indicate the low efficiency of the masks of well-known companies. In addition, the price of some of them is unjustifiably overstated (the cost of Vichy Dercos is 1200 rubles).</p>
                        <p>The lack of effect and excessive cost of analogs led to the fact that every day more and more consumers choose Sea Miracle anti-hair loss mask for daily use.</p>

                        <strong class="h2" name="sea-miracle9">Other methods to strengthen hair</strong>
                        <p>Recently, such a procedure as mesotherapy has become popular. It implies injection of vitamin-therapeutic cocktails directly into the scalp.</p>
                        <p>The procedure is considered quite effective, many consumers note an improvement in the condition and growth of hair. To get a good result, you must hold at least 8 treatments. The cost of the service depends on the type of medication used and will cost an average of about 12,00 euros.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the side effects of high-cost mesotherapy, the most dangerous of which are infection and necrosis of tissues. After the procedure, patients also complain of soreness in the scalp, itching, redness and bruising.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>"Hair loss and slow hair growth is a very common problem with which women of different ages come to me. The most common reason for this is the lack of vitamins in the body. Often patients are asked to advise them of any vitamin-mineral complex. However, I immediately warn patients that with the acceleration of hair growth on the head, the intensity of vegetation in other parts of the body will increase in parallel. That's why instead of vitamin complexes I recommend to adhere to the right, balanced diet and use Sea Miracle anti-hair loss mask. The product proved to be highly effective in practice and completely safe. With the help of it, most of my patients were able to restore the shine hair in just 4 weeks.
