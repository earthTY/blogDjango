                        <strong class="h2" name="easy_lean2">Easy Lean: great customer experience and valuable doctor testimonials</strong>
                        <p>Here are a few recent reviews and testimonials on customer and medical experience with this product:</p>

                        <p><strong>Jane Huntington, MD – American Health Center in Colorado, USA</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“More and more people are diagnosed with excess weight in developed countries worldwide. To a certain extent, it happens because people have no clear idea of how to lose and control weight without exhausting themselves with hard workouts and diet restrictions. If only they could be timely informed that such fat-burners as Easy Lean exists – it could prevent a lot of eating disorders and weight rebound.</p>
                            <p>We recommend it as a separate method for controlled and safe weight loss or in combination with moderate exercising and smart nutrition plans. This product has immense potential: patients can lose 4 to 8 pounds per week (or 2-5 kilos). The process of slim down starts on the very first day. The recommended duration of a weight loss program is 4 weeks. You can freely adjust the course duration to your needs.”</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p><strong>Franz Kaiser, MD – European dietology Clinic (GMS)</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“To prevent the emergence of an unhealthy approach to lose weight, the diet plan should contain at least 20% of products that make people feel good. When the diet lacks such foods, it leads to depression and other psychological problems in 67% of cases. Chocolate is one of the products bringing immense pleasure, and Easy Lean is the perfect dietary supplement from the dietology point of view: on the one hand, it satisfies a craving for sweets and delicious desserts, on the other hand, it is a low-calorie and high-fiber cocktail that can be safely used for extra fat burning. The product assists in weight loss due to pharmaceutically certified organic extracts, so there is no miracle behind it, but pure science. </p>
                            <p>We strongly recommend this natural product to those who wish to lose weight and improve their health without sacrificing a comfortable lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>Important: in pharmacy, there are product analogs, while the original product at an affordable price can be bought online from legit sellers.”</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p><strong>Jennet Piketon, IT specialist, 34 years old</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“I have two kids and work at the office, sometimes work overtime. Because of stress, I started gaining weight 3 years ago and ended up having gained 28 kilos of fat (in comparison to my normal weight before pregnancies). I have serious troubles taking fat-burners in capsules as I feel chocked. This problem made me look for alternatives and I’m so glad I found Easy Lean due to reviews on forums! This product is created in the form of easily soluble powder used for preparing a delicious chocolate drink. I am a sweet tooth, so I appreciate this form a lot!</p>
                            <p>It was super effective for me: I supplemented a breakfast with it, the rest of the day I had meals as usual and never felt hungry. What a surprise! When I stepped on the scales and saw -4,5 kilos after the first week!</p>
                            <p>After a month I managed to drop 18 kilos and I’m not going to stop. No pharmacy fat burners can boast the same effectiveness and such an affordable price. I recommended my friends trying it and would like to recommend it to all of you!”</p>

                        <p>Negative experience listed in testimonials and reviews online can be a “red light” for potential buyers. Why such comments appear?</p>
                        <p>Here are the most common reasons for weight loss fails using Easy Lean:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The product is used to lose weight in case of a disturbed metabolism or thyroid gland dysfunction. Natural organic ingredients can help an average healthy person lose weight, but are not able to cure diseases.</li>
                            <li>Dissatisfied customers received incorrect information on how to apply the fat-burner correctly and used an improper weight loss plan.</li>
                            <li>Customers purchased a counterfeited package at untrustworthy pharmacies online and left negative reviews about original product on forums. Use the official website to know exactly how to use the product and be assured in its quality.</li>

                        <p>Important: during the fat-burning course, make sure you drink enough water to help eliminate the toxins and harmful substances appearing from breaking down the adipose tissue. Increased water intake helps the organism burn fat quicker. Customer reviews say that more water consumed during the day leads to more frequent urination. This can be considered as a minor inconvenience caused by Easy Lean.</p>
