                        <strong class="h2" name="novaricose3">Overview of the constituent components of NoVaricose</strong>

                            <p>The composition of the NoVaricose cream is safe for people and the environment because it basically contains only natural and environmentally friendly components. In particular, here are three important elements that take on the main healing power:</p>

                                <li>pant concentrate - counteracts the disease, heals damaged tissue.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <blockquote><p>Having studied this drug and its chemical composition, I can conclude that it is harmless for most people. However, from the patients about the NoVaricose's reviews were controversial, I concluded that there are a lot of counterfeits on the market that are not entirely harmless. Therefore, I would recommend that patients buy this medicine only in proven places. I would advise taking it under the supervision of a doctor since a philistine cannot in time notice the negative reaction of the organism or complications. Even acting on instructions, a simple person who does not have knowledge in the field of medicine can make a mistake that will undo all the useful effect.</p></blockquote>

                        <p><strong>Igor Semenovich Fedorov, phlebologist:</strong></p>

                        <blockquote><p>I am familiar with this drug, I repeatedly encountered its use and saw results, among which were both positive and negative outcomes. I also examined the NoVaricose reviews, which are different, many avert its odor and other side effects. However, for the sake of justice, we can not fail to note the overall positive dynamics in recovery in people who use this drug for medicinal purposes. Apply NoVaricose according to the instructions that lie inside the package.</p></blockquote>

Gradually the situation worsened, legs began to swell, hurt and dumb. To combat this misfortune, my neighbor advised me this remedy. My husband checked on the Internet, read what constitutes NoVaricose and the doctors' reviews, and then said that you can try. I took a long course for two months. After that, my attending physician was forced to fix significant improvements. Swelling and blushing significantly decreased, the pain was gone.
